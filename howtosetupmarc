SSetting Up and Running GPT Engineer in PyCharm on Windows:

1. Project Environment:
In PyCharm, ensure you have a virtual environment set up for the project. This is usually created by default when you initiate a new project in PyCharm.

2. Installing the Package:
Since you've already cloned the repository and are inside the project in PyCharm, open the terminal within PyCharm.
Install the project dependencies using the following command:
markdown
Copy code
python -m pip install -e .

3. Setting Up the API Key:
In the PyCharm terminal, you can set the environment variable using:
markdown
Copy code
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
Alternatively, in the project directory, you'll find a file named .env.template. Create a copy of this and rename it to .env. Open it and add your OPENAI_API_KEY value there.

4. Running GPT Engineer:
Create a new project folder. In the PyCharm terminal, you can copy the example project with:
markdown
Copy code
xcopy projects\example projects\my-new-project /E
Inside the projects\my-new-project directory, you'll find a file named prompt. Open this file in PyCharm and fill in the desired prompt.
Once you've set your prompt, run GPT Engineer by executing the following in the PyCharm terminal:
markdown
Copy code
gpt-engineer projects\my-new-project

5. Reviewing Results:
After execution, navigate to the projects\my-new-project\workspace directory within PyCharm's project explorer. Here, you'll find the generated files.
6. Additional Commands:
If you need more configurations or command options, you can view them by running:
markdown
Copy code
gpt-engineer --help
